    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At <a href="http://wyred.biz">Wyred</a>, we are creating a nice tool to customize interactions with clients. But there are many things that I don&rsquo;t like about our process. I won&rsquo;t enter into details, but lack of professional experience and time are two powerful reasons.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m starting a new personal project to fill these gaps, at least the one concerning to me. A multiplayer turn-based board game that mimics the <a href="http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Tetra_Master_%28Minigame%29">Tetra Master</a> minigame from Final Fantasy IX. It splits into a server (the fancy part) and a (probably) javascript mobile application. You can see in my github that I already started developing the server part three months ago, but problems always arise and I parked the project. Now I&rsquo;m on holidays, so chances are that it will get a little boost.</p>

<p>Technologies involved into the server subproject are Scala, Akka, Play and Postgresql. I want to update my knowledge to the new concepts introduced with Scala 2.11, Akka 2.3, Play 2.4, and also get a glimpse of Postgresql with Slick. By the way, testing will be implemented using Scalatest, Scalacheck and Mockito. The UI part isn&rsquo;t very clear to me, so I will wait until the server is ready.</p>

<p>This last year, because of my job, I have been working intensively with Mongodb (mainly 2.6). It&rsquo;s an awesome documental database, but <a href="http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/">some articles</a> have convinced me that my Mongodb knowledge, using the excellent <a href="http://reactivemongo.org/">Reactivemongo</a> driver, has deepened too much and I&rsquo;m forgetting about SQL (or other type of) databases and Scala database stuff like Slick. I&rsquo;m getting biased. Hence the choice for this project is Postgresql.</p>

<p>Future posts will track the development process of this funny project.</p>
