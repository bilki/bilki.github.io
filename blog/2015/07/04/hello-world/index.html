<p>Hello World!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m Roberto Serrano, a Software Engineer from Murcia, Spain.</p>

<p>I work at <a href="http://wyred.biz">Wyred</a>, developing personalization tools with Scala, Play, Akka, among other technologies, for spanish telco companies.</p>

<p>Functional programming, distributed systems, nosql databases, and cloud services are some of my current interests.</p>
