Hello World!

I'm Roberto Serrano, a Software Engineer from Murcia, Spain.

I work at [Wyred](http://wyred.biz), developing personalization tools with Scala, Play, Akka, among other technologies, for spanish telco companies.

Functional programming, distributed systems, nosql databases, and cloud services are some of my current interests.

Anime, strategy & war videogames, and zombie stuff occupy almost all my free time.

Have a nice day, and happy coding!
